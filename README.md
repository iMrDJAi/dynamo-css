Webpack template by ${Mr.DJA}!
***
## Usage:
It's simple, run *the following command\** inside an empty directory, make sure that you have **npm** and **npx** installed on your system.

```shell
$ npx imrdjai-webpack-template [--force]
```
*\*Note:* you can also pass **--force** as a parameter to the command to bypass the directory check. DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Features:

This is a very basic and well configured Webpack template. it supports ES modules, SCSS, JSX...

**webpack-dev-server** and **webpack-bundle-analyzer** are included 😁.

To run the dev server use:
```shell
$ npm run start
```

To build the project and launch the bundle analyzer use:
```shell
$ npm run build
```
The template also includes a basic working example, you will find it inside the `src` folder. start working on your project from there.

Enjoy 😉

Wait.. You forgot to leave a star! I think.. ⭐
